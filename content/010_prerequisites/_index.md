# Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< ref "/010_prerequisites/aws_event.md" >}})
* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< ref "/010_prerequisites/self_paced.md" >}}), or

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with **[Create a Workspace]({{< ref "/010_prerequisites/workspace.md" >}})**
